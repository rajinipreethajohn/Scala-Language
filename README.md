# Scala-Language
The GitHub History of the Scala Language

Project Desciption: Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. In this project, I have read in, cleaned up, and visualized the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. Also have found out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

Technology: Python

Tools and techniques used: Joining data with Pandas, Matplotlib

Project tasks: *Scala's real-world project repository data *Preparing and cleaning the data *Merging the DataFrames *Is the project still actively maintained? *Is there camaraderie in the project? *What files were changed in the last ten pull requests? *Who made the most pull requests to a given file? *Who made the last ten pull requests on a given file? *The pull requests of two special developers *Visualizing the contributions of each developer

Topics: 1.Data Manipulation 2.Data Visualization 3.Importing & Cleaning Data
